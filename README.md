This is a full-stack web application inventory tracking system that combines my passion for quilting and coding. Local Auth is provided by passport.js so users can sign up, sign in, and create their collection.

## Optimizations
- Responsive design needs to be done
- Ability to upload images of each fabric
- Sorting and Filtering on table
